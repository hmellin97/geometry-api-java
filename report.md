# Report for assignment 3

## Project

Name: Esri Geometry API
* Mathieu Desponds
* My Helmisaari
* Julian Jaramillo
* Axel Kennedal
* Henrik Mellin

URL to our fork: https://github.com/hmellin97/geometry-api-java

The Esri Geometry API for Java can be used to enable spatial data processing in 3rd-party data-processing solutions.

## Onboarding experience
The project has a decent README. Cloning, building and running the tests using the Maven command line tool was very easy and pain-free. All dependencies are installed automatically by the build script.  The project had 486 tests which all passed. One thing that wasn't clear from the instructions in the repo though was that it requires a Java SDK version lower than SDK 11. Java 8 works, so that's what we went with. We wanted to use IntelliJ for working on this lab. The repo didn't contain any instructions for how to do this, and we had some issues with getting it to work. Eventually we got it working for everyone though and we are going to stick with this project.

Before we went with this project we looked at the Apache Commons library (Java) because we had used it ourselves, but it turned out that the coverage was too high for us to want to continue with it.

## Complexity

1. What are your results for ten complex functions?
   * Did all tools/methods get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?

    * Henrik :
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
    * <name of function 1>
    * <name of function 2>
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?

5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?

## Coverage

### Tools

Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.

How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?

### DYI

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.

The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:

git diff ...

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?

### Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.

Report of old coverage: [link]

Report of new coverage: [link]

Test cases added:

git diff ...

## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).

Carried out refactoring (optional)

git diff ...
